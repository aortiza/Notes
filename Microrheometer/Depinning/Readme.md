# Depinning 

In this folder we find some of the routines necessary for the processing of the depinning experiments.

## Contents 
* The `Processing*` files contain the details of the tracking up until the generation of the angular velocity curves. 
* The Angular velocity vs Torque contains the plots of the depinning transition and hysteresis (or lackthereof).
